Structural Topic Models on the Russian IRA Twitter Dataset


Running the main.R script in will train a structural topic model on the
Russian IRA Twitter Dataset provided by FiveThirtyEight. The program uses
a t-SNE dimensionality reduction to locate anchor words that determine the
number of topics in the model.

Before running any script, you must collect the data. Because the dataset is quite
large, we did not include it in the submission file. Download the data from the following link:

https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/russian-troll-tweets

Once downloaded, place all those .csv files in /CODE/data then run the read-data.R script.



To run the models, run the main.R using R version 3.5+



Note: Requires R version 3.5+
Note: This package has the following dependencies:
		- tidyverse
		- stm
		- quanteda
		- here
		- lubridate
		- tidytext
		- tictoc
	To download these dependencies, run dependencies.R in an R console
Note: It is recommended you use the given R project file to avoid file-path issues.


This project contains 6 scripts:
	1. dependencies.R        -- installs dependencies
	2. read-data.R           -- reads csv files from /DOCS/data
	3. helper.R              -- loads data and pre-processes for modeling
	4. stm.R                 -- run Structural Topic Model using t-SNE embedded anchor-words
	5. final_model_extract.R -- extract data for Tableau app and write files
	6. main.R		 -- main method; runs helper.R stm.R and final_model_extract.R in sequence

The project also contains a .rds file which holds the full dataset.
